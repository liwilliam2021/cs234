Your task is to add calls to a Location API to a piece of text. The questions should help you get information required to complete the text.
You can call the API by writing "[Location(city)]" where "city" is the city of the state you are asking for. Here are some examples of API calls:

Input: From Los Angeles, CA we have that Los Angeles is in the state of California.
Output: From Los Angeles, CA we have that Los Angeles is in the state of [Location("Los Angeles")].

Input: From Seattle, WA we have that Seattle is in the state of Washington.
Output: From Seattle, WA we have that Seattle is in the state of [Location("Seattle")].

Input: From Baltimore, MD we have that Baltimore is in the state of Maryland.
