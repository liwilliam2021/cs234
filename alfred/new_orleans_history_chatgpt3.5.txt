New Orleans history goes back beyond the founding of the city over 300 years ago and contains a whole world of subjects, movements, people, and periods, encompassing colonial history, diasporic history, United States history, arts and culture, technology, war, and so much more. For even longtime lovers and students of the city, it’s a lot to learn. Here at The Historic New Orleans Collection, we never stop looking for stories from our past, and through our publications, programs, and exhibitions—and the First Draft blog—we’ve built a small library’s worth of resources in the form of essays, oral histories, virtual exhibitions, and other online resources. To help introduce readers to New Orleans history writ large, while linking to fuller stories and resources on our website, THNOC’s Visitor Services department compiled this primer—call it New Orleans History 101.

Native Americans

[QA("What was the name given by the Choctaw to the area where New Orleans was founded?")]
When the French founded the city of New Orleans in 1718, they did so at a site that had been used for centuries by Native Americans as a gathering place for trading, forming alliances, and hunting—today’s French Quarter. The Choctaw named the area “Bulbancha,” meaning Land of Many Tongues, signifying the multi-tribal nature of this location. The land itself was situated on higher ground—information that the French might have learned from Native allies in Mobile—due to middens created by discarded oyster shells and sediment deposits. These conditions, along with convenient access to Lake Pontchartrain through the Bayou St. John portage, made Bulbancha an attractive location for settlement. Despite the devastating effects of European colonization, descendants of the people who once gathered at Bulbancha during the pre-colonial era are still here. The Jena Band of Choctaw, Tunica-Biloxi, Coushatta, and Chitimacha are all federally recognized tribes. Although state-recognized since 1977, the Houma still struggle to achieve federal designation.

[QA("Can you provide more details about the architectural design of early French colonial houses in New Orleans?")]
Colonial Architecture
New Orleans was a planned town, designed by French military engineer Le Blond de la Tour in 1721, and the original grid can be seen in today’s French Quarter. Within a few years, settlers and enslaved Africans constructed permanent housing using native cypress. Elevated off the ground, the earliest French colonial houses had pitched roofs, few windows, and no porches. The houses were spaced out, with gardens in between.

[QA("What were the main factors that led to the destruction of French colonial structures during the Spanish colonial period in New Orleans?")]
During the Spanish colonial period (1763–1803), two large fires destroyed 1,068 French colonial structures. The Spanish government enacted building codes in 1795 that restricted the use of timber for multi-story buildings, instead favoring bricks and plaster. As the city rebuilt from the fires, houses were constructed close together, often with shared walls and courtyards. These courtyard homes served as an ideal model for future construction in the French Quarter by addressing two basic problems: the need for increasing density due to a growing population and the sometimes uncomfortable subtropical climate.

[QA("How did enslaved Africans and their descendants contribute to the development of New Orleans?")]
Slavery
New Orleans was built on the enslavement of Africans and their descendants. Enslaved men, women, and children constructed the city’s infrastructure, provided domestic labor, sold goods in the markets, and built many of the houses and buildings still seen today. Their cultural and spiritual traditions, skills, and knowledge fundamentally shaped all aspects of the city. The first enslaved Africans were brought to the city in 1719, a year after its founding. Around 6,000 people were forcibly removed from the West African coast, many from Senegambia, and brought to Louisiana during the French period. The Spanish imported a similarly sized group from the Benin and Congo regions in the 1780s. When New Orleans became an American city in 1803, enslaved Africans and their descendants made up over one-third of the population. By 1820, New Orleans was the center of the domestic slave trade, which forcibly moved over one million enslaved people from the Upper South to the Deep South by 1860.
